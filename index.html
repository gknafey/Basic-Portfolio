                I am studying to become a full stack web developer. My goal is to obtain a job<br>
                where I can work full time and remotely.  I am participated in a Christian <br>
                leadership program for three years where I learned discipline, to lead, and <br>
                communicate effectively with all types of people. I also obtained a degree in <br>
                Environmental Business Economics from Rutgers Unitverity.  After spending a <br>
                significant amount of time in South America, I am almost fluent in the Spanish.<br>
                One day I would like to travel to more countries in the future.
